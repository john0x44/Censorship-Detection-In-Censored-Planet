Folder contains research focused tasks based on censorship detection research project specifically focusing on aiming to standardize network outage data from various platforms and develop both a decision tree and a deep learning model for detecting censorship and work on additional related tasks as needed.

Specific tasks include: 

(a) prepare and standardize network outage data collected from multiple Internet censorship measurement platforms including Censored Planet and OONI, 
(b) to implement a decision tree-based censorship detection algorithm as a research baseline, 
(c) to experiment with deep learning model for censorship detection.
