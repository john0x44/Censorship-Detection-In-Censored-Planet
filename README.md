Censorship-Detection-In-Censored-Planet
Supervised Research Project
# This is a supervised research project

This project focuses on how censorship measurement data can be processed and aggregated to improve the accuracy of detecting censorship while reducing the amount of false positives. By analyzing a large Censored Planet dataset I aim to develop a structured approach for classifying censorship events and be able to differentiate between actual censorship events and non censorship events such as network failures.

Research Question 
How can censorship data be effectively aggregated and preprocessed to improve censorship detection accuracy while reducing false positives? 

Hypothesis 
If censorship data is preprocessed with aggregation techniques and with metadata integration then censorship events can become more accurately identified while reducing false positives.
